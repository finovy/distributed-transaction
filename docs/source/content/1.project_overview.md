#  Project Overview

This project is built upon the Seata TCC mode to create an internal TCC framework, aiming to reduce external dependencies. The framework integrates with various projects through custom components, catering to the needs of internal projects to the fullest extent. It not only possesses complex disaster recovery solutions, including multi-center fault tolerance, but also reaches higher levels in terms of architecture and functionality.
